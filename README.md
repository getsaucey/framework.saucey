##What this is?
Saucey is an Automation framework written in mainly PHP. Designed to kick-ass and take names.

##What it do?
This framework allows testers to:

* Control most aspects of the PC, i.e open a native iOS app with Xcode's iOS Simulator, etc.
* Click, right-click, double-click, triple-click & drag via X/Y coordinates.
* Press any keyboard key(s) either in conjunction or individually.
* iOS/Android gestures, i.e. 4-finger swipe left/right.
* Create & maintain tests for selenium & headless drivers with [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).
* Evaluate API endpoints with business-logic driven code.
* Run load & performance tests.
* Test UI elements with user-driven logic.
* Verify arrangement of files and directories; availability of assets.
* Set server-side, front-end and functional assertions.
* Report coverage and pass-fail status of suites for tests using ALL saucey functionality.
* Connect test suite(s) to a continuous integration system of choice.
